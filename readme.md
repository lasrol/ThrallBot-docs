*Welcome to ThrallBot - A Bot made for use with Discord (https://discordapp.com/)

Thrallbot's job is to play short soundclips (can be long if you wish to annoy everyone in the channel)
The soundfile is played channel wide, NOT server wide, meaning only members in the channel you play it in will hear the soundclip played.

**Prerequisites :

Download Discord (https://discordapp.com/)

**Getting Started : 

*Upload a .mp3 version of the file you wish to have the bot play here -> bot-beta.novos.no

**Usage 

Using ThrallBot is easy! Below is a list of commands that will get you started, followed by examples of usage.
