*Welcome to ThrallBot - A Bot made for use with Discord (https://discordapp.com/)

Thrallbot's job is to play short soundclips (can be long if you wish to annoy everyone in the channel)
The soundfile is played channel wide, NOT server wide, meaning only members in the channel you play it in will hear the soundclip played.

**Prerequisites** :

*Download Discord (https://discordapp.com/)*

**Getting Started** : 

 *Upload a .mp3 version of the file you wish to have the bot play here -> bot-beta.novos.no*

**Usage** 

*Using ThrallBot is easy! Below is a list of commands that will get you started, followed by examples of usage.*

1. **!list**
   
   * shows a list of all files uploaded to your server
     
1.  **!insertfilename**
     
    * Commands the bot to play the selected file
    
1. **!gank**

    * Allows user to send the bot to any channel (within the bot's permissions) to play the selected file. 
      Example : !gank @InsertUser *soundfile* You do not need to write the username after "@" - there will be a list of users currently online for you to choose from. The bot will also leave a message (example "You just got ganked"
