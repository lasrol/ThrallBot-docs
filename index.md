Welcome to ThrallBot - A Bot made for use with Discord (https://discordapp.com/)

Thrallbot's job is to play short soundclips (can be long if you wish to annoy everyone in the channel)
The soundfile is played channel wide, NOT server wide, meaning only members in the channel you play it in will hear the soundclip played.

Prerequisites :

1) Download Discord (https://discordapp.com/)

Getting Started :

Upload a .mp3 version of the file you wish to have the bot play here -> bot-beta.novos.no.
Make sure the filename is in all small capital letters! (test.mp3 will work. Test.mp3 will NOT work)

Ready to play the soundclip you just uploaded? Below is the commandlist used to operate ThrallBot
Using the "!" in front of any command is necessary for the bot to recognize the input.

!list -> Shows the name of all uploaded soundclips on your server.

!insertfilename -> Will play the selected clip (replace insertfilename with your actual filename)

!insertfilename x -> Will play the selected clip X times in a loop (example, !annoying x5)

!gank @ -> Sends the bot to the recipients channel. Meaning you can be in a different channel from where you wish the sound played.
typing !gank @ will show a list of all users currently online on the server, simply select which user you wish to gank followed by the name of the file you wish to have played. Everyone in the recipients channel will hear this clip. 

Example: !gank @user !annoying
