*Welcome to ThrallBot - A Bot made for use with Discord (https://discordapp.com/)*

Thrallbot's job is to play short soundclips *(can be long if you wish to annoy everyone in the channel)*
The soundfile is played channel wide, **NOT** server wide, meaning only members in the channel you play it in will hear the soundclip played.

**Prerequisites** :

*Download Discord (https://discordapp.com/)*

**Getting Started** : 

 *Upload a .mp3 version of the file you wish to have the bot play here -> bot-beta.novos.no*

**Usage** 

*Using ThrallBot is easy! Below is a list of commands that will get you started, followed by examples of usage.*

+ **!list**
   
   - Shows a list of all files uploaded to your server. **PM istedenfor channel wide, Anders?**
     
- **!insertfilename**
    
    - Commands the bot to play the selected file
    
    - You can que multiple repeats of the soundfile selected by adding 'x' at the end of the command (*example: !insertfilename x5*)
    
+ **!gank**

    - Allows user to send the bot to any channel *(within the bot's permissions)* to play the selected file. 
 Â   
    - Example: *!gank @InsertUser *soundfile*
    
    After adding '@' - Discord will list **currently online users** for you to choose from. The bot will also leave a randomized message     to the user getting 'ganked' *(example "You just got ganked")* These messages are currently not sent via PM, rather channel wide.
    
    The bot will follow the user getting 'ganked' if changing channels during the 'gank' *(unless user enters a channel where the bot       has no permissions)* until the soundfile is done playing. Making this a *highly* intrusive, yet fun feature :)
